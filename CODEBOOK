Variables used in the code are as follows:

data_train_x, data_test_x: basically they are datapoints for the various features 

data_train_y, data_test_y: activity labels

data_train_sub, data_test_sub: subject index

data_train: merging data_train related columns

data_test: merging data_test related columns

data_combined: combining data_train and data_test

features: reading in feature labels

feature_names: converting column 2 of features to characters

labels: reading in activity labels

names(data_combined): inserting column names into combined dataset

mean_col_chk, std_col_chk: extracting features which consist of the words "mean" or "std". 

mean_col_names, std_col_names: renamed mean_col_chk, std_col_chk

extracted_data: combine the required data

activity_desc: merge the extracted_data with activity labels such that the activity names are reflected
